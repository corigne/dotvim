# My vim configuration + plugins

  The clang_complete conf is configured for the default clang location on MacOS
  so be sure to change it to where you have clang installed on the host system.

## Installation
1. If .vim does not exist in your home directory already, else goto 2.  
    
    cd ~
    mkdir .vim

2. Then, clone this repository into .vim.  
    
    cd .vim
    git clone https://github.com/corigne/dotvim.git .

3. Run the config script to kickstart Vundle and download the rest of the plugins.  
   
    bash config.sh
