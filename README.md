# My vim configuration + plugins
## Installation
1. If .vim does not exist in your home directory already, else goto 2.  
    ```    
    cd ~
    mkdir .vim
    ```

2. Then, clone this repository into .vim.  
    ```
    cd .vim
    git clone https://github.com/corigne/dotvim.git .
    ```

3. Run the config script to kickstart Vundle and download the rest of the plugins.  
    ```
    bash config.sh
    ```
## Post installation configuration:
